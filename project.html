              Within a team of four we had the objective of developing a mobile
              application idea of our choosing. We opened the ideas up for
              debate and quickly decided the rental app would reach a broader
              audience and would address an issue most are familiar with.
              Finding a rental property in Australia can be a slow and painful
              experience for many.

              Focusing on finding users’ pain points with the current rental
              process in Australia. The key research methods we used were
              competitor analysis, online survey, and one-on-one interviews.<br />
              “Finding a rental is stressful for users, and the current systems
              available to find rentals are outdated and overcomplicated, the

              streamlines and simplifies the process”. <br />
              When interviewee’s were asked on their thoughts on the rental
              process, the response we received were more emotional rather than
              technical responses. Which tells us that users find the current
              process stressful and our solution will have to reduce the stress
              of the rental process

            After building out our unique angle into the real estate space. We
            thought about how our users life may be improved by our app choices
            and features. <br />
            Our User Flow is quite a linear process with a few features created
            by each of us. We each built out the main features of Wishlist,
            Viewing Booking and Instant Application Features.

              Paper wireframes were created based off of our user flow, I drew
              up the design based on our team meetings, we wanted users to be
              able to quickly swipe through options, similar to dating sites.
              <br />
              The other feature we wanted to develop was a “quick apply” button,
              as this function would removed majority of the stress of the
              rental process, unfortunately due to technical reason this is not
              possible as realtors won’t accept applications from someone who
              has not viewed the property.
              <br />
              We pivoted our approach to ensure once the user liked a property
              it streamlined arranging an inspection and had the application
              ready to send post-inspection.

              Three rounds of usability testing on our prototype were performed,
              from low fidelity to high fidelity and at all stages the common
              feedback we received was for the heart icon, as the users still
              didn’t understand the use of heart icon as Wishlist and after this
              feedback we realized that it would be better to create icon that
              is more literal <br />
              Which was unexpected. As we had chosen the icon due to their
              familiarity, the heart often used in shopping apps to mark items
              for the Wishlist. This also highlights why user testing is
              important as it shows how the smallest details can make big impact
              to user’s understanding.
              <br />
              We incorporated the usability testing results into the design, and
              achieved a product we were really proud of

              Our solution to the issues identified in our research is an app
              named Casa, and the logo incorporates the Rook chess piece, known
              to be able to cross the board in one direct move if given a clear
              path. Our goal is to clear the path for renters so they can have
              an easy direct path to finding their new home mi casa es su casa

              Working in this team was really enjoyable, we had an amazing
              fast-paced creative flow, as we were determined to collaborate,
              quickly make decisions and learn from each other.
